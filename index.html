*THE HOUSE IN THE WOODS* <small>MINIGOLIATH _(2020)_ - _UE4_</small>

- <small>Originally a 2 day jam game, then worked on for another week or so.</small>
- <small>Played by a lot of the big YouTubers like Markiplier and did pretty well for us on Itch.</small>
- <small>Made by 2 people, I was responsible for the programming, art, and design/writing along with my partner in MINIGOLIATH.</small>

*TERMINAL* <small>MINIGOLIATH _(2020)_ - _UE4_</small>

- <small>An entry for the Devolver Disc Room Game Jam.  We finished in the top ten.</small>
- <small>I was responsible for the programming, all of the art, audio, and much of the writing and design along with my partner in MINIGOLIATH.</small>

*REVOIDER* <small>MINIGOLIATH _(202?)_ - _UE5_</small>

- <small>REVOIDER is our big ambitious project.</small>
- <small>Developed animation tech and rendering tech specifically for it and have gathered a sizable following on Twitter as well as publisher interest due to visual appeal of the project.</small>
- <small>Currently on hold.</small>

<div class="spacerSmall"></div>

*RadTV* <small>RUFFIAN _(2019)_ - _UE4_</small>

- <small>Responsible for all of the art (shaders, VFX, characters, environments, props, UI assets and Blueprints), including marketing materials and I directed another artist with some extra environment work.</small>
- <small>I was also heavily involved in the design and implementation of key components like the interaction system.</small>
- <small>All of the optimisation from the blueprints to the art to get it going as best it could on Oculus.  It ran really well just below min spec, and we had it on Quest as well although unfinished.</small>

<div class="spacerSmall"></div>

*Fragmental* <small>RUFFIAN _(2017)_ - _UE4_</small>

- <small>Same deal as RadTV, I helped design and produce the game and did all of the art and ui design - with the help of Gary Whitton on the UI.</small>
- <small>I was the only artist at Ruffian while making this game.</small>
- <small>Had it running on a Switch and a Shield as well and it looked great, the game was very well optimised to run as fast as possible.</small>

<div class="spacerSmall"></div>

*The Thing* <small>RUFFIAN _(2012 - 2013)_ - _CryEngine/UE4_</small>

- <small>I directed these as a pitch we made to Microsoft and Universal and we successfully signed the game based on those videos.</small>
- <small>I did the bulk of the art and vfx, although we had an environment artist I directed for a lot of the hard surface stuff.</small>
- <small>Unfortunately, MS restructured about 6 months in and pulled the plug.  We tried to shop it round for a year with Universal still on board but eventually work for hire took over.</small>
